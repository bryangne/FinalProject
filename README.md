Improving MyAnimeList Ratings

MyAnimeList is a rating and review website tailored for Anime TV shows, movies, etc. Currently, ratings are based on the total average of all users who have given ratings for a particular show. However, not all users will rate a title equally. They may have preferences for different genres, and thus be biased when reviewing. That is why a better rating system, which takes into account different groups of users is so useful. By identifying different groupings of users, it will be possible to show them ratings that other users similar to them have given.
