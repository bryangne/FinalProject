    "## Introduction\n",
    "Ratings websites are a great way to learn about a variety of entertainment mediums. From TV shows, movies, songs, to games, ratings give users a general overview of that medium’s popularity. However, these general ratings can sometimes be too general to be informative. Not every user will give ratings the same way. They are sure to have preferences in certain genres, and may dislike others. As such, a general rating may hide different groups of users who on average would rate something differently than users in other groups. For example, shoujo is a demographic for shows that are aimed at younger girls. It makes sense that female users may rate such a show a bit higher than male users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question now is, how do we find these groups of users? It can be very difficult to discern what a user likes simply by looking at what kind of shows they watch or music they listen to. How do we determine if one user is similar to another simply by looking at the shows they watch, or rather the genres that they tend to watch? The answer is to use unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning is a technique in machine learning that takes in data and groups the data based on how similar the data is. It does not need to learn from pre-classified data, it simply learns from unlabeled data and spits out labels for them. For this particular project, we will be using an unsupervised learning algorithm called hierarchical agglomerative clustering.  Now, in order to use this learning algorithm, we will need data. Often, data will not be in a format that will be suitable for use in learning algorithms, which is why the data must be preprocessed. This is what we will be learning in this blog post.\n"

    "### Dealing with Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to figure out how to handle missing values. Typically missing values don't play well with learning algorithms, so we can take several approaches to dealing with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drop the values (rows)\n",
    "    - If the number of rows with null values is very small in proportion to the data set then they can be dropped.\n",
    "2. Drop the column\n",
    "    - If a column has a large amount of missing values, say more than 40% you can elect to drop that entire column. However, you should think about whether this column contains important information that would be beneficial for machine learning algorithms to learn from.\n",
    "3. 'Fill in' the values (imputation)\n",
    "    - Sometimes a missing value may represent an unknown. If the feature is categorical in nature, these null values could be represented as an 'unknown' category rather than a null value.\n",
    "    - In the case of numerical data missing values could be filled in with the mean, or the average. While this keeps the mean the same, it can change the standard deviation or cause other unwanted results.\n",
    "    - A similar approach can be done with categorical values, using the mode, or most common value instead. This comes with its own caveats as well.\n",
    "4. Asking a domain expert\n",
    "    - It may be the case that for your project, you have access to an 'domain expert', someone who is familiar with the data. They may be able to tell you what a missing value means, or how to fill in your data based on their past experience. However, a domain expert is not always available, or it may be very time consuming to fill in data this way.\n",
    "5. Generating new values\n",
    "    - We can use a different machine learning algorithm to fill in the missing values. Using the already known, labeled data the algorithm can learn to fill in the missing values."

If we look up the episodes with missing episodes, it becomes clear that these shows are ones that haven't aired yet, hence the missing episode count. Therefore, their scores should not be relevant since a user can't rate a show that has no episodes. For the shows without a score, it would be difficult to predict the average of users since there are no scores to work with. For these reasons, we should drop them."
